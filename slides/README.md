# Session Description

Singularity lets you toss out your old, stodgy grid system and create a system
of columns and gutters that actually works with your content, allowing different
layouts at different breakpoints, a visual order that isn't tied to your source
order, and no more terrible class names.

# Introduction to Singularity Grids

## You Probably Already Know

## Tellin' 'em what yer gonna tell 'em:

## Presenting like an Airplane: High-level and Fast

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What was 960?

# Why so many 12 column grids?

# What is Singularity?

## Going from 960 (or whatever) to Singularity

## That's all, folks!

## Spanning that 12-column grid

## Weren't we escaping the 12-column menace?

# Asymmetric Grids

## Singularity's `add-grid` argument can be a list instead

## Asymmetric Columns = Varied Widths

## This is useful why, exactly?

> Animate a find and replace of `grid-span` statements.

## Changing Thought Processes

## Do Those Words Sound Familiar?

## Examples In Action


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Another Example: Meet Aunt Flossy

## But This R&eacute;sum&eacute; should be Responsive

## If you used Susy Grids, you think you've already solved this problem, don't you?

## Singularity allows different Grids at Different Sizes:

## Singularity and Breakpoint play well together:

# Look Closer

> Animation of the resume which shows the change in visual order from source order

# Yeah this part isn't finished yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tellin' em' what ya told 'em:

- Singularity is a new kind of grid system which lets you write grids to your
  content, not a convenient least-common-multiple.
- Columns can be equal width "Symmetric" or varied in width "Asymmetric".
- Singularity plays nicely with Breakpoint so that:
  - You can have different column layouts at different sizes.
  - Your "visual" order doesn't have to match your "source" order.
